# Resume Analyzer Using Gemini API and LLM

Welcome to the Resume Analyzer project! This repository contains a tool designed to enhance and optimize resumes using the Gemini API and a Large Language Model (LLM). The tool provides insights, suggestions, and improvements to make resumes more effective and ATS-friendly.

## Features

- **Resume Parsing:** Extracts key information from resumes, such as contact details, skills, experience, and education.
- **Content Analysis:** Evaluates resume content and provides actionable feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- **Keyword Optimization:** Identifies and suggests relevant keywords to improve ATS compatibility.
- **Formatting Recommendations:** Offers tips on formatting and layout to enhance resume presentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Gemini API:** Utilized for advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including information extraction and analysis.
- **Large Language Model (LLM):** Provides contextual analysis and generates recommendations based on resume content.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **API Keys:** Gemini API key (sign up [here](https://example.com/gemini-signup)).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-analyzer.git
   cd resume-analyzer
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your API keys:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Resume Analyzer:**

   ```bash
   python analyze_resume.py path/to/your/resume.pdf
   ```

2. **Review the analysis:**

   The script will analyze the resume and provide feedback directly in the console or save it to a specified file, depending on your configuration.

## Configuration

Customize the analysis by modifying the `config.json` file. Configuration options include:

- `max_length`: Maximum length of text to process.
- `keyword_threshold`: Minimum relevance score for keyword suggestions.
